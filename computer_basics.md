A central processing unit (CPU) is a type of processor that serves as the main logic and control unit of a computer.

A processor, also referred to as a microprocessor in the case of a highly integrated semiconductor device, is a device or system that performs logic operations. These terms and CPU are often used interchangeably.

A modern CPU consists of a single, tiny chip of specially produced silicon (usually a square centimeter or less) on the top surface of which are formed millions of transistors and other circuit elements using a sub-micron fabrication process. Each chip is housed in a high precision ceramic or plastic package and mounted on the motherboard (i.e., the main circuit board on a computer). This chip is also commonly referred to as a processor or as a microprocessor.

Although most personal computers have a single CPU, some high performance computers have multiple CPUs in order to further increase processing throughput (i.e., the amount of data that can be processed per unit of time).

Computers also contain other microprocessors, such as those in disk drives and other peripheral devices. These have much less power and are much lower in cost than CPUs, and they have the important role of relieving the CPU of the burden of having to deal with peripheral functions.

A CPU contains three main sections: (1) an arithmetic/logic unit, (2) a control unit and (3) registers. The arithmetic/logic unit contains circuitry that performs data manipulation. The control unit consists of circuitry for coordinating the machine's activities. The registers are high speed memory cells that are used for holding instructions for data that is currently being processed.

The CPU reads data from the main memory, which consists of RAM (random access memory) chips, by suppling the addresses of the appropriate memory cells along with a read signal. Likewise, it writes data to memory by providing the addresses of the destination cells together with a write signal.


**RAM**

The term random access memory (RAM) is commonly used as a synonym for the main memory (also called primary memory or just memory) of a computer. This is because such memory is generally composed entirely of RAM chips.

The main memory is used to hold portions of the operating system, application programs and data that are currently being used or which are frequently used. This includes the kernel (i.e., the core of the operating system), which is the first part of the operating system to load into memory during booting and which remains there for the entire duration of a computer session. Booting is the process by which a computer starts and automatically loads the operating system into memory.

Physically, RAM consists of a number of DRAM (dynamic RAM) chips, which are combined into modules that are plugged into slots on the motherboard (i.e., the main circuit board on a computer). DRAM is a type of RAM that features relatively low cost and small space consumption. Additional DRAM modules can be added (by even a minimally skilled user) to improve computer performance as long as slots are available on the motherboard.

Characteristics of RAM

RAM derives its name from the fact that its contents can be accessed (i.e., read from and written to) in any order. (Perhaps it should have more descriptively been named non-sequential memory, as it is not accessed in a random manner.) This is in contrast to sequential storage devices and media, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), floppy disks, CDROMs and magnetic tape, for which the data must be accessed to some extent in a fixed order. Thus, the times required to access any locations in RAM are virtually identical, in contrast to disks and tapes, which have delay times that vary according to the location on the media.

RAM features much higher access speeds than storage devices. This is due to the fact that access is entirely electronic and thus there are no moving parts (e.g., magnetic heads and spindle motors) to slow things down. RAM access time is expressed in nanoseconds (millionths of a second), whereas HDD access time is expressed in milliseconds (thousandths of a second).

Another characteristic of RAM is that it is volatile, in contrast to ROM (read-only memory) and storage devices and media. This means that any data stored in RAM is retained only as long as the RAM chips are connected to a power supply. In the case of DRAM chips, moreover, not only must they be connected to a power supply, but also they must be refreshed at frequent intervals (i.e., multiple times per second) by an electric current, hence the term dynamic in their name. The reason is that each bit of data is stored as a charge in a microscopic capacitor, and such charges quickly dissipate without refreshment. Thus, when the power supply is interrupted (e.g., the computer is turned off), the memory contents are lost. When a computer is turned on, the operating system and other files are once again loaded into RAM, usually from the HDD.
