Linux is a high performance, yet completely free, Unix-like operating system that is suitable for use on a wide range of computers and other products. Most distributions (i.e., versions) consist of a kernel (i.e., the core of the operating system) together with hundreds of free utilities and application programs in a coordinated package.

A narrower, and somewhat less common, meaning of the term Linux is just the kernel itself. However, when referring to just the kernel, usually the expression the Linux kernel is used.

Linux was started as a hobby in 1991 by Linus Torvalds while a student at the University of Helsinki (in Finland) because he was unhappy with the MS-DOS operating system that came with his new personal computer. He greatly preferred the much more powerful and stable UNIX that he had been using on the university's computers, but he was not able to afford the high licensing fees for any of the commercial versions then available. Today, Torvalds remains the spiritual leader of the Linux movement, and he still coordinates the development of the Linux kernel.

Linux is a clone of UNIX; that is, it was developed to mimic the form and function of UNIX but its source code was written completely independently (i.e., none of it was copied from UNIX source code). Source code is the version of an operating system or other software as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in a programming language (e.g., the C language in the case of the Linux kernel).

Linux incorporates all of the features that have made Unix-like systems the longest-lived and what many consider to be the best operating systems still in widespread use. That is, it is a multiuser (i.e., allows multiple simultaneous users), multitasking, highly flexible (with regard to configuration), inherently secure (including high resistance to viruses, spyware and other malware) and extraordinarily robust (i.e., resistance to crashing and needing rebooting) operating system. A multitasking operating system is one in which multiple programs or processes (also referred to as tasks) can execute (i.e., run) on a single computer seemingly simultaneously and without interfering with each other.

Yet Linux is much more than just a clone of another highly successful operating system. It also represents a philosophy, one which not only incorporates the simple but elegant Unix philosophy but which also has also taken it a big step further and made it a truly free operating system.


Advantages as Compared With Proprietary Unix-like Systems

Linux has several important advantages over the proprietary Unix-like operating systems (e.g., AIX, HP-UX and Solaris). One is that it is free software. This means that it is free both in a monetary sense and with regard to use. That is, everyone is permitted to download Linux from the Internet (or obtain it from other sources, including from friends) at no cost And everyone is also permitted to use it for any desired purpose, including studying, modifying, extending, installing on as many computers as desired, making copies as many copies as desired and redistributing. This is possible because Torvalds wisely released it under a free software license, the GNU General Public License (GPL).


**Advantages as Compared With Microsoft Windows**

Linux also has some very big advantages as compared with the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems2. The most obvious is that businesses and other organizations can save vast sums of money because there are no licensing fees nor is their any pressure for costly (and often disruptive) upgrades (so-called forced upgrades).

Linux can also cut administration and maintenance costs as compared with the Microsoft Windows operating systems because it is considerably more stable (it rarely crashes or needs rebooting) and is highly resistant to viruses and other malicious attacks.

In addition, Linux has the advantage that it can operate on older hardware that is unsuitable for newer versions of Microsoft Windows. This is because it is much more compactly written. Whereas upgrading to newer versions of Microsoft Windows generally requires costly outlays for new hardware, it is often possible to upgrade to newer versions of Linux without buying any new equipment.
